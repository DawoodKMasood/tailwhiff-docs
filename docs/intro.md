# Introduction
Get started with an open-source set of UI components and elements built with the utility classes from Tailwind CSS.

## What is Tailwhiff?
It includes all of the commonly used components that a website requires, such as buttons, dropdowns, navigation bars and modals.

## Why use Tailwhiff?
One of the disadvantages of Tailwind CSS compared to other frameworks is that it doesnâ€™t have a base set of components. This makes it really hard to quickly prototype a user interface.

**This is where Tailwhiff comes into play:** we have prebuilt commonly used components that you would normally get with a classic CSS framework like Bootstrap or Bulma.

There are at least 19 types of components including buttons, alerts, breadcrumbs, pagination, and navbars.
